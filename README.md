# Question 1

## Solution 1: Python
The Python solution focuses on extracting directly the **first** and **last** numbers from each string, concatenating them, and calculating the sum of the resulting values.

## Solution 2: JavaScript
The JavaScript solution extracts only the list of **numbers** from the string. Since these numbers are still in string format, the first and last indices are extracted, concatenated, and the sum of the resulting values is calculated.
